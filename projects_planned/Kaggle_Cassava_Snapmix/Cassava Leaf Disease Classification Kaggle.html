At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.\n\nExisting methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.\n\nIn this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.\n\nYour task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\u0022note\u0022\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tutorial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe highly recommend \u003ca href=https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-tpus-cassava-leaf-disease\u003eJesse Mostipak’s Getting Started Tutorial\u003c/a\u003e that walks you through making your very first submission step by step.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe **Makerere Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab** is an AI and Data Science research group based at Makerere University in Uganda.

However, you will ensure the External Data is publicly available to use by all participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other participants. The ability to use External Data under this Section 7.C (External Data) does not limit you other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 11 (Winners Obligations). \n\n#### **8.\tSUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS.**\n\nA. *Private Code Sharing*. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”). This prohibition includes sharing Competition Code between separate Teams, unless a Team merger occurs. Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.\n\nB. *Public Code Sharing*. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or kernels associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org][3]) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.\n\nC. *Use of Open Source*. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org][4]) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.\n\n#### **9.\tDETERMINING WINNERS.** \n\nEach Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website\u0027s public leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set.\n\nIn the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.\n\n#### **10.\tNOTIFICATION OF WINNERS \u0026 DISQUALIFICATION.**\n\nThe potential winner(s) will be notified by email. \n \nIf a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the End Date that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria.\n \nIn case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant.  However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph.\n \nCompetition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.\n \nA disqualified Participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle\u0027s sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded.\n \nThe final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.\n\n#### **11.\tWINNERS OBLIGATIONS.**\n\nAs a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:\n\n(a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model\u0027s software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines][5], must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. If the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission;\n\n(b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; \n\n(c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).\n\n#### **12.\tPRIZES.** \n\nPrize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the participants. \n\nAll Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor\u0027s review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).\n\nA potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10.\n\nPotential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. \n\nYou are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above.\n\nIf a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.\n\n#### **13.\tTAXES.** \n\nALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.\n\n#### **14.\tGENERAL CONDITIONS.**  \n\nAll federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations apply.   \n\n#### **15.\tPUBLICITY.**\n\nYou agree that Competition Sponsor, Kaggle and its affiliates may use your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, unless prohibited by law.\n\n#### **16.\tPRIVACY.**\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Competition Sponsor and Kaggle may collect, store, share and otherwise use personally identifiable information provided by you during the Kaggle account registration process and the Competition, including but not limited to, name, mailing address, phone number, and email address (“Personal Information”).

At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.\n\nExisting methods of disease detection require farmers to solicit the help of government-funded agricultural experts to visually inspect and diagnose the plants. This suffers from being labor-intensive, low-supply and costly. As an added challenge, effective solutions for farmers must perform well under significant constraints, since African farmers may only have access to mobile-quality cameras with low-bandwidth.\n\nIn this competition, we introduce a dataset of 21,367 labeled images collected during a regular survey in Uganda. Most images were crowdsourced from farmers taking photos of their gardens, and annotated by experts at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in collaboration with the AI lab at Makerere University, Kampala. This is in a format that most realistically represents what farmers would need to diagnose in real life.\n\nYour task is to classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.\n\n\u003cdiv class=\u0022note\u0022\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tutorial\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe highly recommend \u003ca href=https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/getting-started-tpus-cassava-leaf-disease\u003eJesse Mostipak’s Getting Started Tutorial\u003c/a\u003e that walks you through making your very first submission step by step.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe **Makerere Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab** is an AI and Data Science research group based at Makerere University in Uganda.
