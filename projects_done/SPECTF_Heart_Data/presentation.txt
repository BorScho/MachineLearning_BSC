Applied Machine Learning Process:

Heart Data

Problem Definition:
-------------------
1. Detect conditions for a heart desease based on some metrics/characteristics that have been isolated by some experts. These characteristics are the features in the data-set.
2. Benefits of solving the problem are given by the benefit of a second opinion for the human expert provided by the algorithm. Goal is to better recognize heart desease condition.
3. According to the paper by ??? accompanying the data, the features have been engineered a descision trees and rule-generating heuristics, i.e. by mimiking the human expert decision-making process. 
Explainability is important. Now one could argue since the data-features have been generated with explainability in mind, it is not important to have an explainable, understandable data-evaluation process, i.e. it is feasible to use random forrests and the like for these data. Another possibility would be to use an interpretable approach like a single decision-tree and compare the thus "explained-variance" with the variance of a random-forrest or other algorithm with probably higher prediction-power. One would end up with something like "explainable-variance", "ensemble-magic" and "unexplained variance".

Data Preparation:
-----------------

- check for missing values
- check for feature importance by linear regression modelling or the same feature of other algorithms
- in tabular data prediction Kaggle competition, there were criteria for feature selection: use those here
- transform data: remove unexplainative features, use standard scaler, pca

Spot Check Algorithms:
----------------------
- use a set of standard algorithm families, select the most promising ones for further investigation: done
- use feature selection, standard scaler

Improve Results:
----------------
- use various cluster algorithms
- use gridsearch for hyper-parameter search
- ensemble methods: done (or are there more?)
- extreme feature engineering: attribute decomposition, aggregation ??? polynomial features??

Present Results:
----------------
1. Context: clinical heart desease diagnosis
2. Question: possibility to automatically predict heart desease condition form the extracted features
3. Solution: present trained algorithms to do just that with a certain mean accuracy and variance
4. Findings:
5. Limitations:
6. Conclusion:
