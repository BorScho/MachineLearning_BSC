Smal experiments to answer questions, try out ideas in connection with machine learning

## Abalone ##
Data Set Information:
Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of
rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as
weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

## Spectf Heart Data ##
Data Set Information:
The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal <br> 
and abnormal. The database of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images. As a result, 44 continuous <br> feature pattern was created for each patient. The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns. The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules <br> 
that were 77.0% accurate (as compared with cardilogists' diagnoses).<br> 

## Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set ##
Data Set Information:
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Flu-Shot Competition ##

The goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: <br>
one for h1n1_vaccine and one for seasonal_vaccine.<br>
<br>
Each row in the dataset represents one person who responded to the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.<br>
